### Comments

Use HTML comments for "invisible". Example:

~~~
<!--
   note: format still in development

  - use (*) to mark trans-border site (e.g. more than one country)

  try list or table for now ??
 -->
~~~

Use end-of-line comments using two dashes e.g. `--`

Heading 1 and Heading 2 are comments plus all text before heading 3 are comments.

Use Heading 3 to define a record.

Use Heading 4 to define a nested child record (w/ a parent from heading 3 record).

e.g. (h3 Austria Wien, h4 Austria Wien II)

As an alternative use % or %% for comments.

As another alternative us "Note:" for "literal" comments in Heading 3 sections.



### Markers

- Use * or (*) to mark trans-border sites (shared by two or more countries)

- Use a symbol/marker for location (place type??)  - why - why not??
    - state e.g. Styria
    - region e.g. Salzkammergut
    - city  e.g. Graz
    - country e.g. Hungary
